Dustin had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that Dustin went,
the lamb was sure to go.
 
It followed her to school one day
which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
to see a lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
but still it lingered near,

And waited patiently about,
till Dustin did appear.

“Why does the lamb love Dustin so?”
the eager children cry.

“Why, Dustin loves the lamb, you know.”
the teacher did reply
